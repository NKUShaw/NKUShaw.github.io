The Exploration during my undergraduate stage
======
During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Bachelor's degree of Science in Applied Psychology. A lot of people thought I should be a humanities or social science student. But actually, the psychology education I received covered very hardcore knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Many things happened and many people got acquainted with during this experience, which gradually changed my cognition and helped me find my current life goal.
