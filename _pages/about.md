The Exploration during my undergraduate stage
======
你好
<!-- During my undergraduate studies, I pursued a Bachelor's degree of Science in Applied Psychology. A lot of people thought I should be a humanities or social science student. But actually, the psychology education I received covered very hardcore knowledge of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. Many things happened and many people got acquainted with me during this experience, which gradually changed my cognition and helped me find my current life goal. TBH, I am a trash student under the evaluation standards of universities in Mainland China, so I have been trying to break through this evaluation standard and become the person I want to be. I am also very grateful for the help and opportunities of teachers and students along the way. After four years of summarizing, I believe that zuoti (做题, which means examination-oriented education) is not a fixed path, and education has become more of a screening tool. I was eliminated, but I gained more from the education path outside of zuoti than in the first twenty years of my life. the novel path is practice. Setting aside the threshold set by humans, many things can be done by hardworking, and tasks or jobs that require talent are only a few of them. Therefore, 'Identify and solve problems, summarize and learn theories from practice, validate and strengthen theories in practice' are my core methodology for understanding the world at present. -->
